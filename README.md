Neddinna is a [DSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) for quickly creating light weight web applications in Ruby with really minimal effort. :)

## Installation

Add this line to your application"s Gemfile to install the gem:

```ruby
gem "neddinna"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install neddinna

## Example Usage

Create a folder e.g post_app

Folder structure:

    |-- post_app
      |-- app
        |-- controllers
          |-- application_controller.rb
          |-- post_controller.rb
        |-- models
          |-- post.rb
        |-- views
          |-- posts
            |-- edit.html.erb
            |-- index.html.erb
            |-- new.html.erb
            |-- show.html.erb
      |-- config
        |-- application.rb
        |-- routes.rb
      |-- db
        |-- app.sqlite3
        |-- test.sqlite3
      |-- config.ru
      |-- Gemfile
      |-- Gemfile.lock

## Routes

Neddinna routes are HTTP methods paired with a URL matching pattern, each route is a method.

get "/" do
> Read/Display something

end

post "/" do
> Create some other thing

end

patch "/" do
> Modify something

end

Routes are matched by their definition and the first route that matches a request is invoked.
Route patterns may include named parameters, which can be gotten from the params hash:

get "/hello/:country" do
>"Hello #{params['country']}!"

end

## Views / Templates

Templates are assumed to be located directly under the `app/views` directory.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
